# AoE 4 Overlay

If you are curious about the ELO of people you play against, this is the app for you.

- Recognizes player names on the quickmatch waiting screen 
- Shows the result in an overlay alongside the players names

The app is completely separate of the game and uses text recognition. It will not affect or change any game files.

## Installation
* 
* This is a portable exe, so no installation is needed.

## Limitations
* Only works for quickmatch while you are in the waiting queue
* Supported are only 16:9 screen ratios.
* The app needs to be opened manually while on the loading screen and closed after.

## Open todos
* See the projects tab for ideas and work in progress https://github.com/timohe/aoe4-overlay/projects

# AoE 3 ELO Overlay

If you are curious about the ELO of people you play against, this is the app for you.
- Recognizes player names on the quickmatch waiting screen 
- Shows the result in an overlay

This app is completely separate of the game and uses text recognition. It will not affect or change any game files.

## How it works
* Once you are in a game, just start the app, chose game mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and click start.
* The app will then show you the ELO ranking and winrates of the players
* Data source is the official Age of Empires page

## Prerequisites
* Unfortunately the game UI is build with a lot of dynamic resizing, so OCR struggles with that
* To solve the problem I created a little UI mod which makes the name position static and also changes the names to be black on white. 
* This application will only work with the mod installed
* The mod is currently only compatible with the "legacy" UI mode

## Installation
* Click on "Releases" on the right to get to the download of the current version
* Use the .msi to install it or use the .exe to run it without installation 

## Limitations
* Struggles with special charactes, non-english languages
* Should work with all 16:9 screen ratios, tested with 1440p and 1080p
* Game must run in full screen mode
